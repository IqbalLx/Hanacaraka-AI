# Hanacaraka-AI
Image classsification for javanese script. This project is our final project for Google Bangkit Academy.

In these projects, we build a handwritten character recognition model that recognizes the ancient javanese alphabet (Aksara Jawa), based on a public dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/phiard/aksara-jawa). Thanks for [Phiard](https://www.kaggle.com/phiard) the author of the dataset. The dataset contains twenty ancient javanese alphabet characters.

# How to use

    - My Account --> Look for API section --> Create New API Token
2. You can use the from the original source, however in this script we downloaded it and reupload it to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CvBaHE6bbLP1bpEHTYxnLM0Lio22LlB4/view?usp=sharing).
3. Run our [baseline model](https://github.com/IqbalLx/Hanacaraka-AI/blob/master/Hanacaraka%20AI%20-%20notebook.ipynb) on Google Colab.
4. Next, run our [improved model](https://github.com/IqbalLx/Hanacaraka-AI/blob/master/Hanacaraka%20AI%20-%20notebook%20-%20improved%20model.ipynb) on Google Colab.
