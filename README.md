# Hanacaraka-AI
Image classification for javanese script. This project is our final project for Google Bangkit Academy.

In these projects, we build a handwritten character recognition model that recognizes the ancient javanese alphabet (Aksara Jawa), based on a public dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/phiard/aksara-jawa). Thanks for [Phiard](https://www.kaggle.com/phiard) the author of the dataset. The dataset contains twenty ancient javanese alphabet characters.
