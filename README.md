# Hanacaraka-AI
Image classsification for javanese script. This project is our final project for Google Bangkit Academy.

In these projects, we build a handwritten character recognition model that recognizes the ancient javanese alphabet (Aksara Jawa), based on a public dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/phiard/aksara-jawa). Thanks for [Phiard](https://www.kaggle.com/phiard) the author of the dataset. The dataset contains twenty ancient javanese alphabet characters.

# How to use
1. Go to your Kaggle profile then download your Kaggle API.
    - My Account --> Look for API section --> Create New API Token
2. You can use it from the original source and modify our code then set the dataset to the original one,
    - or, you can downloaded it from our drive. In this script we downloaded it and reupload it to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CvBaHE6bbLP1bpEHTYxnLM0Lio22LlB4/view?usp=sharing).
3. Run our **baseline model** on Google Colab.
4. Next, run our **improved model**.
